{"name":"Starfall","tagline":"Starfall Processor","body":"Starfall is an object-oriented scripting framework for Garry's Mod. It allows for addons to be scripted serverside or clientside by exposing a limited set of functions and monitors how many instructions it executes. It initially was intended to replace Wiremod's aging Expression 2 Processor with something faster and better.\r\n\r\nFeatures of Starfall\r\n--------------------\r\n* _It's Lua_. The only parser and compiler is Lua's own loadstring. Starfall runs native Lua code in a restricted environment. Not only does this mean execution is fast, but all of Lua's features are directly available for use.\r\n* _It's extendible_. SF is a framework; it is not inherently bound to one application. SF is a good choice for allowing players to program parts of your mod.\r\n* _It's safe_. Multiple security measures are in place so that the running code does not break out of its sandbox.\r\n* _It's documented_. SF contains in-code documentation parse-able by an included custom LuaDoc parser.

The interaction, however, is minimal and there are plans to sever this dependency.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
